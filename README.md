# ⚙️ What This Repository Is

A live sandbox for experimenting with:

- Artificial Neural Networks  
- Model optimization strategies  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Dataset behavior analysis  
- Overfitting & regularization experiments  
- Debugging deep learning pipelines  

This is where ideas are tested before they become serious projects.

---

# 🚫 What This Repository Is Not

- Not a polished portfolio  
- Not production-ready  
- Not perfectly structured  
- Not optimized for deployment  

This is raw iteration space.

# 🔁 Typical Experiment Workflow

```
Load Dataset
   ↓
Preprocess & Scale
   ↓
Design Architecture
   ↓
Train Model
   ↓
Evaluate Metrics
   ↓
Analyze Errors
   ↓
Modify & Retrain
```

Iteration > Clean Code.

Understanding > Optimization.

# 📂 Folder Pattern (When Structured)

```
experiment_name/
    ├── dataset/
    ├── notebook.ipynb
    ├── model.py
    ├── train.py
    ├── evaluate.py
    └── results/
```

Sometimes it will be structured.

Sometimes it won’t.

That’s part of the process.

# 📊 Types of Experiments You’ll See

- ANN Classification
- ANN Regression
- CNN Trials (when added)
- Optimizer comparisons (SGD vs Adam etc.)
- Learning rate sensitivity
- Scaling impact analysis
- Regularization experiments
- Loss curve diagnostics

---

# 📌 Datasets

May include:

- Classic ML benchmark datasets  
- Public R datasets  
- Kaggle datasets  
- Custom structured datasets  

Large files may not be uploaded directly.

---

# 📈 Why Keep This Public?

Because improvement should be visible.

This repository reflects:

- Model evolution  
- Mistakes  
- Refactoring  
- Learning velocity  
- Architecture growth  

It’s not about looking impressive.

It’s about getting better.
